              In your eyes, a universe unfolds, A galaxy of love, where stars are
              bold. With every glance, my heart takes flight, In your embrace,
              everything feels right. Your laughter, like a melody, pure and
              sweet, Guides me through life, makes me complete. In the warmth of
              your smile, I find my home, With you, my love, Iâ€™ll never roam.

            <p className="pt-[20px] italic">
              From the moment our eyes first met, A spark ignited, a love beset. In a crowded room, time stood still, A serendipity, a destined thrill.
              Your smile, a beacon in the night, Turned darkness into purest light. With every word, a bond was cast, In that instant, our hearts held fast. The world faded, you were all I saw, In your presence, I
              felt no flaw.
